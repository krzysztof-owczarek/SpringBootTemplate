# SpringMuster

A base SpringBoot project with a simple HelloEndpoint, HelloEndpointTest and Swagger configuration.

Swagger for the application can be reached here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Tried new type of testing (with Spring Mvc, instead of RestAssured)... Still needs to be polished - I don't like the public modifiers used in classes.
